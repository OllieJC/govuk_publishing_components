body: |
  This component is based on the [GOV.UK Design System accordion component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/)
  and is currently experimental because more research is needed to validate it.  If using this component, [please feed back any research findings to the Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/).

accessibility_criteria: |
  The accordion must:

    * accept focus
    * be usable with a keyboard
    * allow the controls to change in appearance when keyboard focus moves to it
    * allow the controls to indicate when users hover their cursor over it
    * be usable with touch
    * be usable with voice commands
    * have visible text
    * indicate to users that each section can be expanded and collapsed
    * tell the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
    * be readable when only the [text of the page is zoomed in](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/font-size-and-zoom-increase-size-of-web-pages#w_how-to-only-change-the-size-of-the-text)
    * zoom in up to 300% [without the text spilling off the screen](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html)
    * pass [colour contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
    * be readable should a [user change colours](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-fonts-and-colors-websites-use)
    * have `aria-controls` set to the `id` of the element containing the accordion panel content
    * have `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` on section content with a value that refers to the button that controls display of the content

  Section headings must use a button element so that users:

    * can toggle sections with the space and enter keys
    * cannot open sections in a new tab or window

  When CSS and / or JavaScript is unavailable, the component must:

  * be fully expanded
  * not be marked as expandable

  with_supplied_identification:
    description: |
      An `id` for an individual accordion is optional as it's automatically generated, but it can be supplied if a specific `id` is required.

      The `id` must be unique across the domain of your service - this is because the open / closed state of individual instances of the accordion persists across page loads using `localStorage`.

      Used as an `id` in the HTML for the accordion as a whole, and also as a prefix for the `id`s of the section contents and the buttons that open them, so that those `id`s can be the target of `aria-labelledby` and `aria-control` attributes.

  with_data_attributes:
    description: |
      Users can add multiple custom attributes to the accordion to each section. Accepts an hash, so multiple attributes can be added.

      The `data_attributes` hash is for the outermost element in the accordion.

      Each item can also have a `data_attributes` hash. These `data_attributes` are placed on the `button` that triggers the opening and closing - useful for differentiating between each section of the accordion.

  with_the_anchor_link_navigation:
    description: |
      Some apps require custom `id`s per accordion section heading. Custom `id`s allow you to link section headings, sometimes across multiple pages. 
      
      For example on [guidance pages for Content Designers, referred to as "manuals",](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/creating-and-updating-pages#associations) each manual includes multiple sets of accordions and will reference between specific sections to easily access content.

      Using the same rules, custom `id`s automatically open accordions when users click within another accordion that links to either 

      * the `id` of an accordion section heading 
      * an `id` within the content of an accordion (this will also automatically navigate to and open accordions on page load)

      This feature will only be used if the `anchor_navigation` flag is passed as `true`. This mitigates performance risk from event listeners on a large number of links.

      Unlike with the accordion-wide custom `id` attribute, any `id`s passed to accordion headings as part of this are not stored in `localStorage`. `id`s do not need to be unique across your domain, but should still be unique in the context of the page.

      anchor_navigation: true
