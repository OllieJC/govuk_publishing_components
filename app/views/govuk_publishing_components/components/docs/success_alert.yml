name: Success alert
description: Used at the top of the page, to summarise a successful user action.
govuk_frontend_components:
  - notification-banner
accessibility_criteria: |
  - should be focused on page load, to ensure the message is noticed by
    assistive tech
  - Should have a role of ‘alert’ to communicate that is a important and
    time sensitive message
examples:
  default:
    data:
      message: Message to alert the user to a successful action goes here
  with_message_and_description:
    description: Descriptions can be passed as plain text but it is strongly recommended that you pass these as html, cleaned using `raw` or `sanitize`.
    data:
      message: Message to alert the user to a successful action goes here
      description: <p class="govuk-body">A further description</p>
  with_custom_title_id:
    description: |
      This is for the heading element at the head of the component (reading "Success" by default) where the id is used by an `aria-labelledby` on screen reader focus of the element.

      Please ensure that this id is unique across the view you are building.
    data:
      message: Message to alert the user to a successful action goes here
      title_id: my-custom-success-id
  with_styled_link:
    description: If you need to include a link in your success alert, you need to specify the `govuk-link` and `govuk-notification-banner__link` classes on that link element. This is in line with GOV.UK Design System guidance that the colour of the link in success notification banners can look jarring if any links are a different colour to the principal colour used by the success banner.
    data:
      message: Message to alert the user to a successful action goes here
      description: <p class="govuk-body">A further description with <a href="/a-cool-page" class="govuk-link govuk-notification-banner__link">a link</a></p>
